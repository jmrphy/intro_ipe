## Overview

My goal: To give you a roadmap of what we know in IPE today, while emphasising the most important questions we still need to find answers for (that means you!)
    - I'll drop names and give you links to whatever might interest you
    - But otherwise stick to broad issues and questions

1. A short history of IPE
2. Some things we think we know
3. Some things we don't know (but need to)
    - Globalization and/or neoliberalism?
    - Global capital and the runaway rich
    - Repression and social control

## A Short History of IPE

1. For most of human history, the study of global political economy was a humanist tradition
    - Basically, it refers to old white men with classical educations ruminating
    - A combination of law, philosophy, politics, and economics
2. Only in the early 1970s is "IPE" established as a specific field of the social sciences
    - Combines mainstream economics with political analysis
    - Emphasises scientific hypotheses which can be tested against empirical data
    - In the "British School", big names include Robert Cox and Susan Strange, etc.
    - In American IPE, big names include Gilpin, Keohane, Kindleberger, etc.

## What have we learned from modern IPE as a social science?

1. Our strongest findings are based on economic theory, and modeled as such
    - Known as "open economy politics" (Lake 2006)
    - They emphasise rational, strategic actors competing
    - They tend to be formal, specific, and quantitative
2. The distributive political effects of international economics
    - Example: increasing economic integration benefits certain domestic groups and harms others
3. The international effects of domestic politics
    - Example: domestic politics shape interntional economic policy

## But who is this good for?

1. Mainstream IPE is the epitome of "bourgeois political economy"
2. It does not speak truth to power!
2. It speaks the truth *of* power, *for* power.
3. But we can use IPE to decipher power, rebel, and change the world.

## Globalisation and/or neoliberalism?

1. Since the 1990s, all we hear about is "globalisation"
    - The increasingly free flow of capital, goods and services around the globe
    - We're told this is an international pressure forcing the hands of governments
2. But it tends to ignore or downplay the "neoliberal revolution" of the 1970s and 1980s
    - When rich U.S. elites and economists decided to wage class war on the globe
    - Ever since, national oligarchies have emerged and united into a global elite
    - Citizens everywhere are losing democratic control of their politicians
    - IPE remains rather happily unconcerned with all of this
3. How can we use the tools of IPE to better understand this global social war?

## Globalisation vs. neoliberalism continued

Some leads:

1. "Free trade agreements" are not really about "free trade""
    - They're about increasing rights of capital over citizens
    - "What can we change to make the rich in both countries happier?"
    - Often shrouded in lies and secrecy
      - Examples: NAFTA (Faux) TPP (link)

2. As states open internationally, they also (sometimes):
    - Cut essential welfare spending (cite)
    - Repress and torture dissidents (cite)
    - Get rich and make corporations richer (cite)
    - Lose touch with voters (cite)
    - Use the media as cover, or repress it (me)
    
3. IPE remains very ignorant about how much "globalisation" has masked "neoliberalism"

## What has caused the rise of the global super-rich and what are the effects?

## Repression and social control?
